<br />

In this lab we're going to create a 3 ≥·µà Virtual Machine called ```attack-vm``` and we're going to perform actions against our current environment.

From the **Attack-VM** we're going to act as an attacker and attemp to log into the **SQL Server Database**, the **Windows Vm** & the **Linux VM with SSH**.

After that we'll observe the **Logs Generated** from those actions.

We are basically simulating someone trying to break into our environmet, and then see what logs are created, just to get a good sense of what happens behind the scenes.

<summary> <h2> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create our Attack Virtual Machine</h2> </summary>
<br>

The first thing we're going to do in this lab is **Create another Windows VM outside of the US** to simulate an attack from anyhere in the world.

Go to the **Azure Portal** > Click on **Virtual Machines** > **Create a Virtual Machine**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)


- Name the Resource Group: ```RG-Cyber-Lab-Attacker```
- Region:  Outside the US ‚ûú ```Australia Central``` for example
- Virtual Machine Name: ```attack-vm```
- Image: ```Image 10 Pro```
- Size: at least ```2vcpus```
- Username: ```labuser```
- Password: ```Cyberlab123!```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/259c4d7a-ca98-4046-93a0-3472a839f47d)

For the **Networking Tab** ‚ûú Name the **Virtual Network**: ```Lab-VNet-Attacker```

Then click **Review + Create**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe92eaa7-a8b2-4cee-a0bb-6f7dd36b1450)

<h2></h2>

<br>

Now we're going to log into the Attack VM to make sure it works:

- Copy the Attack Vm's **Public IP Address**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f614eae5-0760-45a9-8d83-4f5f8ec6f258)

- We're going to open **Microsoft Remote Desktop** > Add a New PC > Paste the **IP Address for the Attack VM**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/217832f9-3203-43a2-9b7b-524f0253f7b0)

- Double Click the **"New Added PC"** and type in the **Username & Password Credentials** we set up earlier:

  - Username: ```labuser```
  - Password: ```Cyberlab123!```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6622b8a-2af8-4c19-9823-c1f4594ae7e1)

‚úÖ We were able to log in to the VM

<summary> <h2>2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate some Failed RDP Logs against the windows-vm</h2> </summary>
<br>

> From within the **Attack Vm**, we're going to **attemp to RDP connect to the Windows VM**.
> 
> The logins will fail, but some Logs will be generated for us to look at later inside the Windows VM.

<br>

Go back to the **Azure Portal** and copy the **Public IP Address of the Windows VM**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55a2c962-8229-4fa1-89df-d7a9264e9e45)

Now inside the **attack-vm** > open **Remote Desktop Connection** > Paste the **Public IP Address of the Windows VM** and connect

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1790beb-344f-4d2d-af49-9a6f30f282f8)

For the **Credentials** ‚ûú use some random made up **Username & Password** ‚ûú username ```josh``` for example

Since this user does not exist in the Windows VM ‚ûú the **Log In will Fail**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba4a924d-eb07-474c-8020-21e4ce0ad6d7)

Repeat the **Failed Log In** 2 more times with the same **Wrong Username & Password**

<br>

‚úÖ So 3 Logs have been Generated on the Windows VM ‚ûú which we will analyse later

> 
> Still within the **Attack VM**, we're going to install **SSMS** ‚ûú which we'll use to attempt to log into the SQL Server

<br>

Go back to the **Attack VM** > Using **Microsoft Edge** > You can **[Download SSMS through this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms)**

Open the **SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe** File from the Downloads > **Install** it

<br>

Now we're going to open **SSMS**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8be34c69-6216-4aa7-b2f3-d633f2d82c2b)

Then we'll copy the **IP Address of the Windows VM** ‚ûú which has the **SQL Server**

- in Server Name: we'll Paste the **IP Address**
- Authentication: **SQL Server Authentication**
- then our Real **Username** is ```sa``` & **Password** is ```Cyberlab123!```

  - but we're going to login with a user that doesn't exist ‚ûú so we can **Generate Failed Logs**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edb1c19c-5959-4764-a183-c74a9e5d6e76)

We'll **Attemp and Fail** to Login 2 more times to **Generate a total of 3 Failed Logins**

Then we'll "Login For Real" with the correct **Username** & **Password** just to show that we can Login from **Australia (Attack VM)**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f70930a6-50b1-49f5-8fad-7b56571eaed1)

We can then disconnect from the Server:

> This will allow us to **Generate some Logs in our Linux VM** & and analyse them later as well

<br>

Going back to the **Azure Portal** > Go to **Virtual machines** > Open the ```linux-vm``` > copy its **Public IP Address** 

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf625627-4567-452b-b13e-d07a8f4cb4b9)

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4668916b-869d-4065-8274-99063e0625ba)

Then inside the Attack VM ‚ûú we'll open **Powershell**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8426567a-374f-42f1-b2bf-bf01ad2c2f9e)

Now we can **SSH** ‚ûú use a **Fake Username** ```josh``` ‚ûú this Username doesn't exist on the **Linux VM**

So we'll type: ```ssh "FAKE USERNAME"@"DESTINATION (which is the Linux VM)"```  ‚ûú press "Enter" to attempt to connect:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fb6f2d1-c152-43e3-b771-f1bc10716e71)

Type **"yes"** to Accept the Certificate:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf5dc7e4-245f-4864-b849-5105d1fa1b4d)

Then it'll ask us to **Enter our Password**

This **User doesn't even exist**: so whatever Password we put ‚ûú it's going to **Fail to Login & Create a Log**.

Basically we're attempting to **Brute-Force into the Linux VM**  ‚ûú do it 3 times to **Generate 3 Failed Logins**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fab202f7-a7a0-4007-a1ae-df4dc01e9097)

Then we can actually Shut Down our **Attack VM** ‚ûú we won't be using it anymore for this Lab ‚ûú and go back to our own Computer

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6922b5a7-bf0e-46b9-ac0b-b79be1074f97)

<summary> <h2>5Ô∏è‚É£ Inspect the Logs for RDP & SQL Server in the Windows VM</h2> </summary>
<br>

> So now we're going to connect back to the **Windows VM** ‚ûú take a look at the **Event Viewer** ‚ûú and look at the **Logs we Generated**
> 
> We'll do the same thing with the **Linux VM** after ‚ûú look at the **Logs we Generated** by attempting to Log into it

<br>

Inside our **Windows Vm** > Copy the **Public IP Address**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8119aa20-9f4f-4424-a1f8-0630ec596de2)

Open **Remote Desktop** > connect to the **Windows VM**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ad32938-0e9a-4b11-8c2b-c05a7ad42f10)

Then open **Event Viewer**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/926e5fa9-2c64-4711-b66d-5f887bf8a554)

Again, this is where the logs are ‚ûú First we're going to check out the **"Security"** ones.

These are the logs for when someone attempts to **Connect with Remote Desktop** or even try to **Map a Remote File Share**.

Event ```4625``` is the **Failed Logon Event** ‚ûú and we can see a whole bunch of them here:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4784cf0d-b0a6-456b-90d6-f4ad67433c18)

We didn't generate most of these.

If we **"Filter Current Log"** > and type ```4625``` just to see the **Failed Logons** ‚ûú it'll show us only the **Failed Logons**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cf93df3-ff56-4530-bde5-4d96953ba8c2)

We can see the the **"Account Name"** is different for each Event ‚ûú and these are **actual bad actors or bots** on the Internet.

These are not our **Intentional Failed Logons** ‚ûú these are other randon entities trying to **Logon to our VM**, since it's been on for the previous 10 hours.

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba3540e9-6dbe-4787-b3f1-c12cf654065f)

If we scroll down we can actually find **Our Own Failed Logon** with the **Username** ```josh```

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/369ab5b2-bc4f-454d-9920-e7715fdaea48)

‚ö†Ô∏è Aside from our 3 **Intentionally Generated Failed Logs**:
- We can see that there were almost **2000 different Attempts to Break Into our Windows VM**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f796671-51d0-456a-874f-4692309a73e9)

<br>

> Next, because SQL Server is actually installed on this Windows VM ‚ûú we're going to check the **"Application"** Logs.
> 
> In the Windows Event Viewer, the **SQL Logs** get registered in the **Application Tab** instead of the **Security Tab**.

<br>

Right away ‚ûú  we can see our Successful Login with the User ```sa```:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2da67ee-82d6-49f5-9ff5-9622555f97b8)

We're also able to see the **Failed Logins** into the **SQL Server** using the made up **Username** ```josh``` ‚ûú  which does not exist in the **Windows VM**:

<br>

To **Attempt to Connect to the Linux VM** ‚ûú we first need the get the **IP Address of the Linux VM**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e383e43-822b-406f-83d6-7ed9692019dc)

From our Computer:
- if you're using a **Mac** ‚ûú **open Terminal**
- if you're using **Windows** ‚ûú **open Powershell**

And type in the following:

```commandline
ssh labuser@PUBLIC IP ADDRESS OF THE LINUX VM
```
<br>

Press **"Enter"** > then type the **Password**: ```Cyberlab123!``` > then press **"Enter"** again

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96d6e073-43de-413b-9371-97b70d671a65)

We are now Logged Into the **Linux VM**

To see the **Logs** we can type in the following **Linux Command**:

```commandline
cd /var/log
```
<br>

‚òùÔ∏è This will basically change our Directory to the **Log's Directory**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71f782a5-c731-4926-bc70-7af4558e9e4d)

And then we can type ```cat auth.log | grep password``` to pull out all the "lines" that have the word **"Password"** in it:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f73e017f-4b09-4685-bc6c-ea81a1ea614c)

We can see a whole bunch of **Failed Password for Invalid User** Events:
- Meaning ‚ûú some entities were trying to **Login to our Linux VM** from **Random IP Addresses** using **Wrong Credentials**.

We can also see our **Successful Logins** using the **Username** ```labuser```:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33d290c3-390f-4ead-bd48-f58e662a7eb5)

If we filter through:
- ```Accepted``` ‚ûú  we can see that only we were able to **Successfully Login**:

```commandline
cat /var/log/auth.log | grep Accepted
```
<br>

- ```josh``` ‚ûú  we can see all the **Unsuccessful Login Attempts** with the Username "josh":

```commandline
cat /var/log/auth.log | grep josh
```
<br>

# Conclusion


We have to keep in mind hat if we have, let's say, 1000 computers in our Environment ‚ûú  it would be too laborious to just login into each one of them, and analyse the each log indivudually this way.

That's why we are going to **Automatically Ingest all the Logs into a Central Repository**.

We'll Set Up Queries to Automatically look through the Logs and Alert us on certain Events.

This is the end of our **Logging and Monitoring Lab**, and in the next phases we're going to Inspect Logs, Create Incidents & Respond to those Incidents.
