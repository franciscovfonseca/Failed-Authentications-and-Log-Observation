In this lab we're going to create a 3 ≥·µà Virtual Machine called ```Attack-VM``` and we're going to perform actions against our current environment.

So from the **Attack-VM** we're going to act as an attacker and attemp to log into the **SQL Server Database**, the **Windows Vm** & the **Linux VM with SSH**.

After that we'll observe the **Logs Generated** from those actions.

<summary> <h2> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create our Attack Virtual Machine</h2> </summary>
<br>

The first thing we're going to do in this lab is **Create another Windows VM outside of the US** to simulate an attack from anyhere in the world.

Go to the **Azure Portal** > Click on **Virtual Machines** > **Create a Virtual Machine**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)


- Name the Resource Group: ```RG-Cyber-Lab-Attacker```
- Region:  Outside the US ‚ûú ```Australia Central``` for example
- Virtual Machine Name: ```attack-vm```
- Image: ```Image 10 Pro```
- Size: at least ```2vcpus```
- Username: ```labuser```
- Password: ```Cyberlab123!```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

For the **Networking Tab** ‚ûú Name the **Virtual Network**: ```Lab-VNet-Attacker```

Then click **Review + Create**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

<h2></h2>

<br>

Now we're going to log into the Attack VM to make sure it works:

- Copy the Attack Vm's **Public IP Address**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

- We're going to open **Microsoft Remote Desktop** > Add a New PC > Paste the **IP Address for the Attack VM**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

- Double Click the **"New Added PC"** and type in the **Username & Password Credentials** we set up earlier:

  - Username: ```labuser```
  - Password: ```Cyberlab123!```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

‚úÖ We were able to log in to the VM

<summary> <h2>2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate some failed RDP Logs against the windows-vm</h2> </summary>
<br>

> From within the **Attack Vm**, we're going to **attemp to RDP connect to the Windows VM**.
> 
> The logins will fail, but some Logs will be generated for us to look at later inside the Windows VM.

<br>

Go back to the **Azure Portal** and copy the **Public IP Address of the Windows VM**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

Now inside the **attack-vm** > open **Remote Desktop Connection** > Paste the **Public IP Address of the Windows VM** and connect

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

For the **Credentials** ‚ûú use some random made up **Username & Password** ‚ûú username ```Josh``` for example

Since this user does not exist in the Windows Vm ‚ûú the **Log In will Fail**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

Repeat the **Failed Log In** 2 more times with the same **Wrong Username & Password**

<br>

‚úÖ So 3 Logs have been Generated on the Windows VM ‚ûú which we will analyse later

<br>

<br>

Copy the Attack Vm's **Public IP Address**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

We're going to open **Microsoft Remote Desktop** > **Add a New PC** > Paste the **IP Address for the Attack VM**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

Double Click the **"New Added PC"** and type in the **Username & Password Credentials** we set up earlier:

- Username: ```labuser```
- Password: ```Cyberlab123!```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

‚úÖ We were able to log in to the VM

> We're not actually going to do anything with SQL, we're not going to put any data in there, it's just going to serve as another Endpoint for people to attack and we're going to ghenerate logs with it.

<br>

You can **[Download SQL Server here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2019)**

Download the EXE file and install it on the VM:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

In this case we're going to **Download Media**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

We'll download an **ISO** and put it on the **Desktop**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

After it's been downloaded, right-click the ISO file and click **Mount**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

Look for the **SqlSetup** on your PC and then actaully install SQL by clicking on the **setup** file:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

Afte the SQL setup opens, just click **Instalation** and then **New SQL Server stand-alone installation**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c10e90-33da-4cf3-a40c-802f76edf858)

Accept the "license terms" and click "Next" until reaching the **Feature Selection** Tab where you want to tick the ‚òë **Database Engine Services** check box:

We'll use Mixed Mode for SQL Server Authentication and Windows Authentication:

By default SQL Server can have an admin account called "sa" (for system administrator), so we'll set up the password for this

- Username: ```sa``` (default)
- Password: ```Cyberlab123!```

We'll also add the current Windows User, which will make our User ```labuser``` able to Authenticate and "log into" our SQL instance.

Click on **"Add Current User"** and it will add the current user ```labuser``` as well

**<summary> üìù Summary</summary>**

We can view all the logs for the Windows VM through the **Event Viewer**.

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

For example if we go to Windows **Logs** > **Security** > click on one of the **Events / Logs** ‚ûú we can se the details: ***"An account was successfully logged on."***

Whenever someone fails a login, or has a succesful login ‚ûú that's going to be recorded in the **Event Viewer** and we can see it:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

<br>

> Basically what we're doing right now is set up the **SQL Server** ‚ûú so that when somebody **Fails to Authenticate** against it, we'll be able to see the logs for that in the **Event Viewer**

> The **Windows Registry** is a place in the computer where we can make a lot of granular configurations to affect the way the OS behaves.

  </details>

<br>

<br>

First we're going to open the **Registry Editor**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

Paste the following Registry path inside it (instead of browsing to it):

```HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Security```

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

Then we'll right-click the **Security** key > click on **Permissions**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

Add the ```NETWORK SERVICE``` account to the permission > and thick the ‚òë boxes **Full Control** and **Read**

Click **"Apply"** and then **"OK"**:

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

Now we'll **Enable Auditing from SQL Server**

From the Start menu > type **cmd** > right-click on **Command Prompt** and **Run as administrator**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

Paste the following **statement** > press **"Enter"** > and you can see that the command was **successfully executed** ‚úîÔ∏è

```auditpol /set /subcategory:"application generated" /success:enable /failure:enable```

<br>

The next thing to do is open the **SSMS**, log into it and **Enable Auditing**.

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

To Connect to the SQL Server ‚ûú  we can select **"SQL Server Authentication"** and use the **SQL Server system administrator credentials** we had set up earlier:

- Username: ```sa```
- Password: ```Cyberlab123!```

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

Then we'll go to the **Properties** of the Server we just connected to > go to **"Login auditing"** > and check ‚óâ **Both failed and successful logins**

This way all the login attempts can be logged to the **Event Log**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

And finally we just have to **Restart** the Server ‚ûú right-click on the **windows-VM SQL Server** and click on **"Restart"**:

# Conclusion

<br>

In this lab we:

- Disabled the **Internal Firewall on the Windows Computer**.

- Installed the **SQL Server Database into the Windows Computer**.

- Logged into the **Linux Computer with SSH**.

<br />

Now we will leave our Virtual Machines ON for the at least 24 hours

‚û°Ô∏è This will give bad actors, bots or attackers a chance to **Discover our VMs** and **Generate Logs**.
